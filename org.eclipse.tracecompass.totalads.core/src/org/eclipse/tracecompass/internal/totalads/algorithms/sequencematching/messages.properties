SlidingWindow_DBUpdated=Database updated..
SlidingWindow_Description=SQM works by extracting sequences of length \u2018n\u2019 from a trace by sliding a window one event \
(e.g., system call) at a time. For example, for a trace having system calls \u201C3, 6, 195, 195\u201D, \
two sequences \u201C3, 6, 195\u201D and \u201C6, 195, 195\u201D of length 3 can be extracted. SQM extracts sequences \
from normal traces and then compares them against the sequences in an unknown trace. If a new \
sequence is found in an unknown trace then it is considers it as anomalous. The Hamming distance \
between sequences can be used to adjust the decision threshold to reduce false alarms; e.g., a \
sequence \u201C3, 5, 195\u201D is anomalous for above sequences but the mismatch occurs only at one \
position\u2014i.e., a Hamming distance difference of only one. If the minimum Hamming distance matching \
criterion is set to more than one, then it is a normal sequence.
