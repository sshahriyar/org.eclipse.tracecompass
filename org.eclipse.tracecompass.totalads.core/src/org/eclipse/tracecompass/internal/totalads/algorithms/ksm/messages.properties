KernelStateModeling_Abort=KSM: No system call names found in the last trace. Further processing aborted\!
KernelStateModeling_AnomsAtAlpha=Anomalies at alpha {0} are {1}
KernelStateModeling_Description=KSM focuses on detection of anomalies by transforming system calls into states of kernel modules.\
A system call can be classified into eight different states: file system state, kernel state (KL), \
memory management state (MM), networking state (NT), inter process communication state (IPC), security state (SC), \
architecture state (AC) and (a rare) unknown state (UN). KSM then identifies anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states \
in normal and anomalous traces. During the training and validation phases, KSM learns the probabilities \
of states from traces, adjust a decision threshold fAlpha, and use this information to evaluate states of\
traces in the testing phase. State representation facilitates in reducing computation complexity and \
allows system wide anomaly detection with a lesser false positive rate than other techniques.
