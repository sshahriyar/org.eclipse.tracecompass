AlgorithmSelectionPage_AlgSelTitle=Algorithm Selection
AlgorithmSelectionPage_NoDescription=No description is available
AlgorithmSelectionPage_SelAlgorithm=Select an algorithm
AlgorithmSelectionPage_SelectAlgForDescription=Select an algorithm to see its description
AlgorithmSettingsPage_AdjustSettings=Adjust Settings of the Algorithm
AlgorithmSettingsPage_AlgorithmSettings=Algorithm Settings
CreateModelHandler_NoConn=No database connection exists....
CreateModelWizard_NewModel=Create a New Model
ModelNamePage_Description=A model is actually a database in the database management system. A model's name is\n\
 the name of that database. This model creation wizard only creates an empty model.\n\n\
 A model is built when an algorithm is trained on the the normal execution traces (or logs).\n\
 This is done  in the modeling view or the live monitor (training and testing) view.
ModelNamePage_EnterModelName=Enter the name of a model
ModelNamePage_ModelLabel=Model Name
ModelNamePage_ModelTitle=Model Name
ModelNamePage_NoSpecialCharacters=A model name cannot contain underscore or special characters
